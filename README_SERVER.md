## Need to Edit Document before submitting final  

This is as of Nov 20, 2024.   
Will move to docker images for caddy and nodejs application in future
Tested using curl on Nov 20, 2024.   
Web workloads - passing 

**Description**  
This serves the purpose of testing web workloads on http2(TCP) and http3 (QUIC) for further analysis.  

We have a Caddy web server that listens for https traffic on port 443 and proxies the request to nodejs application running port 8000. Caddy has built in support for http3. It also uses self signed certificates for https local testing. We will be using self signed certificates.  

Curl with http3 can be used in two ways-
- Installed locally
- Docker   
  
Remove "--http3" flag to test TCP.


**For testing**
```
$ caddy run
$ cd cs536_jm/server
$ npm start

$ curl -I --http3 https://localhost
OR
$ docker run -ti --network host --rm alpine/curl-http3 curl --insecure --http3 -I https://localhost  

$ curl -I --http3 https://localhost/files  
OR
$ docker run -ti --network host --rm alpine/curl-http3 curl --insecure --http3 -I https://localhost/files 

```

### Developer Notes

**Install Caddy**
```
sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install caddy
```
```
cd /etc/caddy
```

**Modify Caddyfile** 
```
  The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

localhost:443 {
    # Enable TLS for localhost (Caddy will automatically use self-signed certs for localhost)
    tls internal

    # Set the custom header based on the request protocol version (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3)
    header {
        X-HTTPS-Version "{http.request.proto}"
    }

    # Reverse proxy requests to your Node.js backend on localhost:8000
    reverse_proxy localhost:8000
}


# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile

```


**Install Node**
```
# installs nvm (Node Version Manager)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
# download and install Node.js (you may need to restart the terminal)
nvm install 22
# verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
node -v # should print `v22.11.0`
# verifies the right npm version is in the environment
npm -v # should print `10.9.0`

```
**Backend Nodejs server**
```
cd server
npm start
```

**Test using curl- http2 (TCP) and http3 (QUIC)**
```
    # Response: "Hello World!" (Text) 
    docker run -ti --network host --rm alpine/curl-http3 curl --insecure --http3 -I https://localhost  

    # Response: html and css files
    docker run -ti --network host --rm alpine/curl-http3 curl --insecure --http3 -I https://localhost/files 
```
<!-- for installing curl with http3 -->
<!-- sudo LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/openssl/lib64" ./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local --with-nghttp3=/usr/local --with-ngtcp2=/usr/local -->
